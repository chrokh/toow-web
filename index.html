          <h1 class="mb-2">The Few Simple Ideas Behind Every OOP Pattern and Principle</h1>
          <p class="fs-3">Have you ever wondered why there are so many rules in object oriented programming?</p>
          <p>I asked myself that question a decade ago.</p>
          <p>This book is the result of everything I've learned since.</p>
          <p>I'm Christopher Okhravi (PhD), a Senior Lecturer at Uppsala University and a YouTuber with over <strong>150,000 followers</strong>. I've spent the last ten years decoding OOP — so you don't have to.
          </p>
          <p>This is a <strong>practical</strong> and <strong>language-agnostic</strong> guide to OOP. It gives you <strong>mental models</strong> to reason about complexity and choose the right abstraction at the right time.</p>
          <p>I use this book when teaching. Now, it can be yours.</p>

          <p>Inside, you'll learn how to think about OOP — not just memorize it. For example:</p>

          <ul class="list-unstyled fs-5">
            <li class="mb-1">✅ When to choose dependency injection over instantiation.</li>
            <li class="mb-1">✅ When to choose dependency injection over instantiation.</li>
            <li class="mb-1">✅ When to use interfaces or composition over inheritance.</li>

            <li class="mb-1">✅ How bridge is like a strategy within a strategy.</li>
            <li class="mb-1">✅ How dependency injection and replacing conditionals with polymorphism lead to dependency inversion.</li>
            <li class="mb-1">✅ How observables are like events, observers like delegates, and how they all relate to asynchronous and reactive programming.</li>
            <li class="mb-1">✅ How iterators and enumerables relate to streams and infinite lists.</li>
            <li class="mb-1">✅ How the visitor pattern is like pattern matching.</li>
